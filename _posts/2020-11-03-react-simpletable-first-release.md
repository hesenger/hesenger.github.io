I've just released first version of simple table to 
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hesenger/react-simpletable) /
[github](https://github.com/hesenger/react-simpletable).

SimpleTable is a simple component to render selectable 
tables based on json data. This is the very first version 
of a component that I used in my projects but the 
original code is too dependent.

**I'm porting the "remote feature" to load data based on `url` property with paging support**.
