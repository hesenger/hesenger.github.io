Although graduated as a laywer, I was have been worked as a professional 
fullstack developer since 2007 and started to code a bit before this.

At the beggining desktop softwares were still in a high demand 
and I started writing in languages like Visual Basic 4/6 and 
Delphi 5/7. At this point common databases for me were Access, 
Sybase and Firebird.

Today I spend my time with most contemporary technologies for 
Mobile and Web Development like C#, Java, Javascript, Sql Server, 
SQLite and others.

Angular, React and React Native, Cordova, ExtJS are some of my
favorites tools.

Just I hate repetitive tasks, is common that make simple scripts
or programs to automate that, and I trying to organize better 
this tiny tools to share as OSS.

Feel free to make contact or contribute to any projects that I
describe here or share through my 
[github profile](https://github.com/hesenger).
